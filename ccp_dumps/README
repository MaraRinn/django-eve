In order to import the CCP data, you will first need to download the SQLite
dumps from: 

    http://eve.no-ip.de/apo131/
    
At the time of this document's writing, the file name is:

    apo131-sqlite3-v1.db.bz2
    
You do -NOT- want the eam version. It is stripped down a lot and is missing
all kinds of information that we use.

Download and extract the DB file and place it in your ccp_dumps directory
without changing the name. You are then ready to run the importers.
