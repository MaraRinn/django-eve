In order to import the CCP data, you will first need to download the SQLite
dumps from: 

    http://eve.no-ip.de/dom111/
    
At the time of this document's writing, the file name is:

    dom111-sqlite3-v1.db.bz2
    
You do -NOT- want the eam version. It is stripped down a lot and is missing
all kinds of information that we use.

Download and extract the DB file and place it the same directory as your
settings.py file. You will then want to rename it to ccp_dump.db. You are then 
ready to run the importers. This is generally done like this:

    python manage.py eve_import_ccp_dump
    
Note that this will take a very long time to run, possibly over an hour. You
should only have to do this once, though.
